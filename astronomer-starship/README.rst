Astronomer Starship Plugin
==========================

Apache Airflow Plugin meant to assist customers migrating Variables, Connections, and Environment Variables from a source Airflow environment to an Astronomer environment.

Initial Setup
-------------
1. Add the following line to your ``requirements.txt`` in your source environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    astronomer-starship

2. Once your source environment installs ``astronomer-starship`` via the ``requirements.txt``, you will see a new Astronomer menu. Hover over that menu and select the ``Migration Tool ðŸš€`` option

3. After opening the plugin page, you will need to authenticate to Astronomer. To do this, please:

    a. Click the ``Get Token`` button
    b. If you are prompted to sign-in to cloud.astronomer.io please do so
    c. Copy the access token that appears in the new tab
    d. Paste the access token into the ``Authentication Token`` field
    e. Click the ``Sign In`` button

4. After authenticating to Astronomer, you will need to select the deployment that you are sending metadata to. To do this, select a deployment from the ``Target Deployment`` dropdown and click the ``Select`` button

Migrating Airflow Connections
-----------------------------

To migrate connections from your source Airflow meta-database:

1. Click on the ``Connections`` tab:

Utilizing DAGs Cutover Tab
--------------------------

The DAGs Cutover Tab can be utilized to pause DAGs in the source environment and unpause DAGs in the target environment (as long as the DAG id in both the source and target environment match). To do so, please:

1. Click on the ``DAGs Cutover`` tab:

.. image:: https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/cutover-tab.png
   :width: 800

2. In the table displaying the DAGs present in both the source and target environments, click the Pause icon under ``Local``

.. image:: https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/cutover-pause-local.png
   :width: 800

3. In the table displaying the DAGs present in both the source and target environments, click the Start icon under ``Remote``

.. image:: https://github.com/astronomer/starship/raw/master/astronomer-starship/images/cutover-start-remote.png
   :width: 800

4. After completing this process, you will see the DAG is paused in the ``Local`` environment (so you will see a Start Icon) and is unpaused in the ``Remote`` environment (so you will see a Pause icon)
