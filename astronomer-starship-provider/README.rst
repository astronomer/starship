Astronomer Starship Provider
=============================

An Apache Airflow Provider package containing Operators from Astronomer. The purpose of these operators is to better assist customers migrating Variables, Connections, and Environment Variables to Astronomer hosted Airflow environments from MWAA, GCC, and OSS environments. This provider is meant for MWAA 2.0.2 and Google Cloud Composer 1 environments in particular, as webserver plugins are unavailable in these environments.

Installation
------------

Install and update using `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install astronomer-starship-provider


Usage
-----
1. Add the following line to your ``requirements.txt`` in your source environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    astronomer-starship-provider

2. Add the following DAG to your source environment:

.. code-block:: python

   from airflow import DAG

   from astronomer.starship.operators import AstroMigrationOperator
   from datetime import datetime

   with DAG(
      dag_id="astronomer_migration_dag",
      start_date=datetime(2020, 8, 15),
      schedule_interval=None,
   ) as dag:

      AstroMigrationOperator(
          task_id='export_meta',
          deployment_url='{{ dag_run.conf["deployment_url"] }}',
          token='{{ dag_run.conf["astro_token"] }}',
      )

3. Deploy this DAG to your source Airflow environment, configured as described in the **Configuration** section below
4. Once the DAG is available in the Airflow UI, click the "Trigger DAG" button, then click "Trigger DAG w/ config", and input the following in the configuration dictionary:

   - ``astro_token``:  To retrieve an Astronomer token, navigate to `cloud.astronomer.io/token <https://cloud.astronomer.io/token>`_ and login using your Astronomer credentials
   
   - ``deployment_url``: To retrieve a deployment URL - navigate to the Astronomer Airlow deployment that you'd like to migrate to in the Astronomer UI, click ``Open Airflow`` and copy the page URL (excluding ``/home`` on the end of the URL)
   
     - For example, if your deployment URL is ``https://astronomer.astronomer.run/abcdt4ry/home``, you'll use ``https://astronomer.astronomer.run/abcdt4ry``  
     
   - The config dictionary used when triggering the DAG should be formatted as:
   
.. code-block:: json

        {
            "deployment_url": "your-deployment-url",
            "astro_token": "your-astro-token"
        }


5. Once the DAG successfully runs, your connections, variables, and environment variables should all be migrated to Astronomer

Configuration
--------------
The `AstroMigrationOperator` can be configured as follows:

- ``variables_exclude_list``: List the individual Airflow Variables which you **do not** want to be migrated. Any Variables not listed will be migrated to the desination Airflow deployment. 
- ``connection_exclude_list``:  List the individual Airflow Connections which you **do not** want to be migrated. Any Variables not listed will be migrated to the desination Airflow deployment. 
- ``env_include_list``:  List the individual Environment Variables which you **do** want to be migrated. Only the Environment Variables listed will be migrated to the desination Airflow deployment. None are migrated by default.

.. code-block:: python

      AstroMigrationOperator(
          task_id='export_meta',
          deployment_url='{{ dag_run.conf["deployment_url"] }}',
          token='{{ dag_run.conf["astro_token"] }}',
          variables_exclude_list=["some_var_1"],
          connection_exclude_list=["some_conn_1"],
          env_include_list=["FOO", "BAR"]
      )
