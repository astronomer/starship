Astronomer Starship
===================
A suite of Apache Airflow utilities containing Plugins and Operators from Astronomer. The purpose of these utilities is to better assist customers migrating Variables, Connections, and Environment Variables to Astronomer hosted Airflow environments from MWAA, GCC, and OSS environments, as well as Astronomer Software and Nebula instances.

Depending on the source environment, either the Webserver Plugin or the `AstroMigrationOperator` should be used for migrating these elements.

**Note:** In order to use the Starship utilities, the source Airflow environment must be running Airflow 2.x

Choosing the right package
--------------------------
- The `AstroMigrationOperator` should be used if migrating from a Google Cloud Composer 1 (with Airflow 2.x) or MWAA v2.0.2 environment. These environments do not support webserver plugins and will require using the `AstroMigrationOperator` to migrate Connections, Variables, and Environment Variables.
- The `Starship Plugin` should be used for migrating from all other environments including Google Cloud Composer 2, MWAA v2.2.2, OSS, and Astronomer Software/Nebula instances.

Installation
------------
Installation for both the plugin and operator are the same

Install and update using `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install astronomer-starship


Usage
-----
1. Add the following line to your ``requirements.txt`` in your source environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    astronomer-starship

2. Add the following DAG to your source environment:

.. code-block:: python

   from airflow import DAG

   from astronomer_starship.starship.operators import AstroMigrationOperator
   from datetime import datetime

   with DAG(
       dag_id="astronomer_migration_dag",
       start_date=datetime(2020, 8, 15),
       schedule_interval=None,
   ) as dag:

       AstroMigrationOperator(
           task_id="export_meta",
           deployment_url='{{ dag_run.conf["deployment_url"] }}',
           token='{{ dag_run.conf["astro_token"] }}',
       )

3. Deploy this DAG to your source Airflow environment, configured as described in the **Configuration** section below
4. Once the DAG is available in the Airflow UI, click the "Trigger DAG" button, then click "Trigger DAG w/ config", and input the following in the configuration dictionary:

   - ``astro_token``:  To retrieve an Astronomer token, navigate to `cloud.astronomer.io/token <https://cloud.astronomer.io/token>`_ and log in using your Astronomer credentials

   - ``deployment_url``: To retrieve a deployment URL - navigate to the Astronomer Airlow deployment that you'd like to migrate to in the Astronomer UI, click ``Open Airflow`` and copy the page URL (excluding ``/home`` on the end of the URL)

     - For example, if your deployment URL is ``https://astronomer.astronomer.run/abcdt4ry/home``, you'll use ``https://astronomer.astronomer.run/abcdt4ry``

   - The config dictionary used when triggering the DAG should be formatted as:

.. code-block:: json

        {
            "deployment_url": "your-deployment-url",
            "astro_token": "your-astro-token"
        }


5. Once the DAG successfully runs, your connections, variables, and environment variables should all be migrated to Astronomer

Configuration
--------------
The ``AstroMigrationOperator`` can be configured as follows:

- ``variables_exclude_list``: List the individual Airflow Variables which you **do not** want to be migrated. Any Variables not listed will be migrated to the desination Airflow deployment.
- ``connection_exclude_list``:  List the individual Airflow Connections which you **do not** want to be migrated. Any Variables not listed will be migrated to the desination Airflow deployment.
- ``env_include_list``:  List the individual Environment Variables which you **do** want to be migrated. Only the Environment Variables listed will be migrated to the desination Airflow deployment. None are migrated by default.

.. code-block:: python

      AstroMigrationOperator(
          task_id="export_meta",
          deployment_url='{{ dag_run.conf["deployment_url"] }}',
          token='{{ dag_run.conf["astro_token"] }}',
          variables_exclude_list=["some_var_1"],
          connection_exclude_list=["some_conn_1"],
          env_include_list=["FOO", "BAR"],
      )


Running Telescope Report
------------------------
To run the Telescope Report, to get a snapshot of your source Airflow Instance

1. Hover over the Astronomer menu in the Airflow UI and select ``Run Report üî≠ Telescope``
2. Enter your Organization's Name
3. (Optionally) Enter a pre-signed URL if you were supplied one, or request one from your Astronomer representative
4. Hit "Send/Download Report"
5. If you didn't use a pre-signed URL, send the report to your Astronomer Representative.

More information about this report can be gathered from https://github.com/astronomer/telescope#what-is-it


Astronomer Starship Plugin
==========================

Starship is an Airflow Plugin meant to assist customers migrating Variables, Connections, and Environment Variables from a source Airflow to an Astro Airflow.

Initial Setup
-------------
1. Add the following line to your ``requirements.txt`` in your source environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    astronomer-starship

2. Once your source environment has ``astronomer-starship`` installed, you will see a new Astronomer menu. Hover over that menu and select the ``Migration Tool üöÄ`` option

.. image:: images/menu-item.png

3. After opening the plugin page, you will need to authenticate to Astronomer. To do this, please:

    a. Click the ``Get Token`` button
    b. If you are prompted to sign-in to cloud.astronomer.io please do so
    c. Copy the access token that appears in the new tab
    d. Paste the access token into the ``Authentication Token`` field
    e. Click the ``Sign In`` button

4. After authenticating to Astronomer, you will need to select the deployment that you are sending metadata to. To do this, select a deployment from the ``Target Deployment`` dropdown and click the ``Select`` button

FAQ
---
- If you have an error installing Starship via pip and see a message like :code:`ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed`, add the dependencies that are listed in the error to your :code:`pip install` or :code:`requirements.txt`, e.g.

.. code-block::

    ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
    rich 10.9.0 requires typing-extensions<4.0.0,>=3.7.4; python_version < "3.8", but you have typing-extensions 4.6.3 which is incompatible.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install astronomer-starship rich==10.9.0

- If you have an error with Starship coming up and you see a message like :code:`Broken plugin: [astronomer.starship.main] Parameters to Generic[...] must all be type variables`, upgrade :code:`typing-extensions`

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install typing-extensions==3.10.0.2

- If you are on >=Airflow 2.7 and wish to test connections, you must have `AIRFLOW__CORE__TEST_CONNECTION` Set. See notes `here <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/release_notes.html#disable-default-allowing-the-testing-of-connections-in-ui-api-and-cli-32052>`_
